> A C compiler. From scratch. By someone who knew exactly what they were doing. Probably

Welcome to **Curo** - a lovingly hand-crafted C compiler that walks the fine line between systems programming and psychological horror. If the name rings a bell... seek help

I know what kind of man you are, you filthy animal *(Iâ€™m not better)*

### How to use?

I wish I knew myself

### For help, check:  
- Commits
