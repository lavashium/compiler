### ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFESSIONS OF THE CODESTAINED ‚ö†Ô∏è

Herein lieth mine confession, writ by mine own trembling hand.

Verily, I hath succumbed to most grievous sins during the crafting of this compiler. In the haze of nightly toil and cursed macros, I did scrawl upon the holy commit logs the mark of the Beast ‚Äî *"e621 joke :3"* ‚Äî an utterance most foul and degener‚Äôd. I, being of sound mind but corrupted spirit, do hereby repent for mine transgressions.

By the moons of July, in the year of our Compiler Two-Thousand Five-and-Twenty, I let Lust guide my fingers and Pride blind mine architecture. The spirits of Modularity and Separation-of-Concerns wept as I defiled `main.rs` with unclean side effects and unholy macros.

Let this parchment bear witness: I seek redemption through refactors unending, through lifetimes most arcane, and through macros clean and pure.

**Oh Rustacean Father**, deliver me from stack overflows, cyclic borrows, and cursed `unsafe`.

May ZAWARUDO strike only in debug,
May Pawprint reveal mine sins with #[derive(Debug)],
And may the Great Linter judge me gently.

Forgive me, for I knew not what I `git commit -m`...
